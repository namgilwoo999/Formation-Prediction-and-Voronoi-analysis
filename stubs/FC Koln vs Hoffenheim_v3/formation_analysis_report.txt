FORMATION RECOGNITION ANALYSIS REPORT
============================================================

Team 0:
------------------------------
  Ground Truth Formation: 4231 (433에서 파생됨)
    → Normalized to: 433 (base formation)
  Most Predicted Formation: 4141 (433에서 파생됨)
    → Normalized to: 433 (base formation)
  Strict Accuracy: 0.0%
  Flexible Accuracy (with normalization): 100.0%
    → Higher flexible accuracy because formations in same family are considered equal
    → 4231 and 4141 both belong to 433 family
  Average Similarity Score: 0.793
  Analysis Type: Overall formation (full video)
  Predictions matching Ground Truth (after normalization):
    - 4141 (433에서 파생됨)
  Partial Matches (same family but different variant):
    - 4141 ≈ 4231 (both are 433 variants)
  Formation Distribution:
    - 4141 (433에서 파생됨): 1 (100.0%) ≈

  Legend: ✓ = exact match, ≈ = same family
